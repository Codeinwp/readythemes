The Sucuri Security - SiteCheck Malware Scanner is a security plugin enables you to scan your WordPress site using Sucuri SiteCheck for security and malware issues, and also verifies the security integrity of your core files right in your dashboard. It also includes post-hack security ions to help you reset passwords and secret keys in case it has been already hacked, or infected with malware.

== Description ==

Sucuri SiteCheck will check your site for malware, spam, blacklisting and other security issues like .htaccess redirects, hidden eval code, etc. The best thing about it is it's completely free.

You can also check for malware, blacklisting, and overall security status by scanning for free at <a href="http://sitecheck.sucuri.net">SiteCheck.Sucuri.net</a>.

Sucuri SiteCheck detects various types of malware, SPAM injections, website errors, disabled sites, database connection issues and code anomalies that require special attention to include:

* Obfuscated JavaScript injections
* Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
* Website Defacements
* Hidden & Malicious iFrames
* PHP Mailers
* Phishing Attempts
* Malicious Redirects
* Anomalies
* Drive-by-Downloads
* IP Cloaking
* Social Engineering Attacks


There are a number of blacklisting authorities that monitor for malware, SPAM, and phishing attempts. Sucuri SiteCheck leverages the APIs for these authorities to check your website blacklisting status:

* Sucuri
* Google Safe Browsing
* Norton
* AVG
* Phish Tank (Phishing Specifically)
* ESET
* McAfee SiteAdvisor
* Yandex

We augment the SiteCheck Malware Scanner with various. 1-click hardening options. Some of these options do not provide a high level of security, but collectively these options do lower your risk floor:

* Verify WordPress Version
* Protect Uploads Directory
* Restrict wp-content Access
* Restrict wp-includes Access
* Verify PHP Version
* Disable the theme and plugin editors

On the newest versions of the plugin we also added an option to verify all WordPress core files for changes,
which can be useful to detect hidden backdoors.

Note that if your site is compromised and you need urgent help, you can leverage the 
Sucuri plans here: http://sucuri.net (even if our free options are not finding
the compromise on your site).
